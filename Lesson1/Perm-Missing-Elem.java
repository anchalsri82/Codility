/**
 * A zero-indexed array A consisting of N different integers is given. 
 * The array contains integers in the range [1..(N + 1)], which means that exactly one element is 
 missing.
 * Your goal is to find that missing element.
 * Write a function:
 * class Solution { public int solution(int[] A); }
 * that, given a zero-indexed array A, returns the value of the missing element.
 * For example, given array A such that:
 * A[0] = 2
 * A[1] = 3
 * A[2] = 1
 * A[3] = 5
 * the function should return 4, as it is the missing element.
 * Assume that:
 * N is an integer within the range [0..100,000];
 * the elements of A are all distinct;
 * each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..(N + 1)].
 * Complexity: 
 * expected worst-case time complexity is O(N);
 * expected worst-case space complexity is O(1), beyond input storage (not counting the storage required for input arguments).
 * Elements of input arrays can be modified.
